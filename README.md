This is a demo project for working out issues with new react features ([hooks](https://reactjs.org/hooks) and [context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html)) with [react-blessed](https://github.com/Yomguithereal/react-blessed).

```
npm i           # install tools & deps
npm run blessed # run blessed demo
npm run dom     # run basically the same demo, in dom
```

Currently, the blessed demo isn't working.
